# veery

Veery is a simple machine learning model for MNIST using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org).

### Background

This project is part of [52projects](https://donny.github.io/52projects/) and the new stuff that I learn through this project: [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org).

### Project

Veery is my attempt to learn more about machine learning using TensorFlow. It's my first exposure to this area and I've been watching and reading quite a few resources:

- [Learn TensorFlow and deep learning, without a Ph.D.](https://cloud.google.com/blog/big-data/2017/01/learn-tensorflow-and-deep-learning-without-a-phd)
- [TensorFlow and deep learning - without a PhD by Martin GÃ¶rner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq2nnJ4g6N0)
- [Getting Started with TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/get_started)
- [MNIST for ML Beginners](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/mnist/beginners)

Shown below is a screenshot of running a trainable linear regression model from [Getting Started with TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/get_started) and a model for MNIST from [MNIST for ML Beginners](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/mnist/beginners):

### Implementation

The code [`linear_model.py`](https://github.com/donny/veery/blob/master/linear_model.py) shows how we use TensorFlow to solve the equation: `y = W * x + b`. Given `x` and `y`, find the value of `W` and `b`, with the following training data: `x: [1, 2, 3, 4], y: [0, -1, -2, -3]`. From the screenshot above, the solution was `W` equals -0.9999969 and `b` equals 0.99999082; which is very close to the actual answer of `W` equals -1 and `b` equals 1.
